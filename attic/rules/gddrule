Congruent Triangle. 
Triangles are called congruent if they have the same size and shape. That is, corresponding angles have the same measure, and corresponding sides have the same length.

* 26  #ASA
ASA (angle-side-angle) congruence: 
Two triangles are congruent if a pair of corresponding angles and the included side are equal. 

* 27 #SAS
SAS(side-angle-side) congruence
Two triangles are congruent if a pair of corresponding sides and the included angle are equal.

* 28 #SSS
SSS (side-side-side) congruence
Two triangles are congruent if their corresponding sides are equal.

* 29 #SAS
SAS (side-angle-side) congruence for right triangles.
Two right triangle are congruent if their two corresponding cartesian edges are equal.

Similar triangles
Similar triangles are triangles that have the same shape but possibly different size. In particular, corresponding angles are congruent, and corresponding sides are in proportion.

* 31 #AAA
AAA (angle-angle-angle) similarity
If two triangles have two corresponding angles that are congruent, then the triangles are similar. Because the sum of the angles in a triangle must be PI, we really only need to know that two pairs of corresponding angles are congruent to know the triangles are similar.

* 32 #SAS
SAS (side-angle-side) similarity
The side-angle-side (SAS) similarity test says that if two triangles have two pairs of sides that are proportional and the included angles are congruent, then the triangles are similar. 

* 33 #SSS
SSS (side-side-side) similarity
If two triangles have all three pairs of sides in proportion, the triangles are similar.

Middle Connection Theorem for Triangles
The line connect the midpoints of two sides of triangle is parallel to the third side of the triangle.

* 36
The hypotenuse of a right triangle is the diameter of the circumscribed circle of the triangle, and the midpoint of the hypotenuse is the center of the circle.
For a right triangle ACB, if AC 〕 BC and D is the midpoint of AB,  then DC = DA = DB, D is the center of circle ABC.

An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides have equal lengths.

Pythagorean Theorem
In any right triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse (the side of a right triangle opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs (i.e. the two sides other than the hypotenuse).
