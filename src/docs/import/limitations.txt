Allowed objects: points, segments, lines, circle.
The Midpoint command and creating orthogonal lines are supported.
Circles can have only one designated intersection point.

Lines are loaded as segments.

Not supported at the moment (among other objects):
Parallel lines, perpendicular or angle bisectors.
These need to be constructed via simple Euclidean steps (see above).

Colors and other properties of the objects are ignored.
