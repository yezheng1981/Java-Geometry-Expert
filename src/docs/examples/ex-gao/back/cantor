Congruent Triangle. 
Triangles are called congruent if they have the same size and shape. That is, corresponding angles have the same measure, and corresponding sides have the same length.

* 26 
ASA (angle-side-angle) congruence: 
Two triangles are congruent if a pair of corresponding angles and the included side are equal. 

* 27
SAS(side-angle-side) congruence
Two triangles are congruent if a pair of corresponding sides and the included angle are equal.

* 28
SSS (side-side-side) congruence
Two triangles are congruent if their corresponding sides are equal.

* 29 
SAS (side-angle-side) congruence for right triangles.
Two right triangle are congruent if their two corresponding cartesian edges are equal. 

* 30
Similar triangles
Similar triangles are triangles that have the same shape but possibly different size. In particular, corresponding angles are congruent, and corresponding sides are in proportion.

* 31
SAS (side-angle-side) similarity
The side-angle-side (SAS) similarity test says that if two triangles have two pairs of sides that are proportional and the included angles are congruent, then the triangles are similar. 

* 32
SSS (side-side-side) similarity
If two triangles have all three pairs of sides in proportion, the triangles are similar.

* 33
AAA (angle-angle-angle) similarity 
If two triangles have corresponding angles that are congruent, then the triangles are similar. Because the sum of the angles in a triangle must be PI, we really only need to know that two pairs of corresponding angles are congruent to know the triangles are similar.

Middle Connection Theorem for Triangles
The line connect the midpoints of two sides of triangle is parallel to the third side of the triangle.

Pythagoras Theorem
In any right triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse (the side of a right triangle opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs (i.e. the two sides other than the hypotenuse).
