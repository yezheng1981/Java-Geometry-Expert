<h2>GEX and JGEX  </h2>
<p>Since the pioneering work by the eminent Chinese mathematician Wen-Tsun Wu, great
  achievements have been made by world-wide researchers in geometry theorem proving. Hundreds
  of difficult theorems whose traditional proofs require enormous amounts of human intelligence,
  such as Feuerbach's theorem, the Morley trisector theorem, etc., have been proved
  totally automatically by computer programs based on Wu's algorithm. Inspired by the success
  of Wu's method, researchers were also successfully in applying another algebraic method, the
  Grobner basis method, to the same class of geometry theorems that Wu's method addresses. The book <span class="wiki">[1]</span> contains a collection of 512 theorems mechanically proved by Wu's
  method.  </p>
<p>The proofs with algebraic methods are generally not readable because polynomials with hundreds
  or even thousands of terms are generated during the proof processes.
  During the 1990s the methods for generating human-readable proofs were introduced. Notably
  the area method <span class="wiki">[4]</span> and the full-angle method <span class="wiki">[5] </span>can generate elegant and short (sometimes
  even shorter than those given by geometry experts) proofs. Our deductive basis method based
  mainly on the full-angle method<span class="wiki"> [6]</span> can not only generate proofs, but also can discover (and
  prove) possibly new theorems.</p>
<p><br />
  The software Geometry Expert (GEX) was originally developed around 1994 at <a href="http://www.wichita.edu">Wichita State University</a> by  S. C. Chou, X.  S. Gao, and J. Z. Zhang. It consists
  of two parts: the proving and reasoning part, and the drawing part. The dynamic nature of its
  drawing part is comparable to that of Gabri and the Geometer's Sketchpad.
  However, GEX uses Openwin under X-Window which is no longer supported by the Linux
  distributions after 2000. Thus we could not satisfy the requests for GEX from students and
  researchers in the world after 2000.</p>
<p><br />
  <strong>Java Geometry Expert</strong><br />
  The Java Geometry Expert (Java GEX or JGEX) has been rewritten completely with emphasis on its ease
  of use by high school students and teachers in geometric drawing for educational purpose.
  The primary goal of Java GEX is to provide a piece of alternative and free software for dynamic
  geometry. We began this project in 2004 and plan to release the first official version in 2008.</p>
<p> Since Java is platform-independent, people can use Java GEX at any platform by downloading
  the compiled Java bytecode to their local machines. Also any user with a browser and the
  INTERNET connection can use a part of our JGEX at  <a href="http://woody.cs.wichita.edu">http://woody.cs.wichita.edu</a>  to see examples. We have prepared a few dozens of examples. Please click
  the example menu item to play with these examples. In these examples, points with the red or
  green color are free or semi-free points that can be dragged with the mouse.</p>
