<h2>An Automated Theorem Prover </h2>
<p><span class="STYLE12">1. Geometric and Non-Geometric Drawing</span></p>
<p><br />
  In JGEX, The diagram generated by it is
  geometric. At the right beginning of developing the drawing part of JGEX, we have kept the
  proving and reasoning as our final goal since we treat geometric elements, such as points, lines,
  and circles symbolically. Then we can apply the reasoning methods developed for over a quarter
  of a century to proving and/or discovering properties of a geometric diagram constructed. We call
  this kind of drawing Geometric Drawing.</p>
<p><br />
  For a diagram generated by JGEX, we keep a set of algebraic equations of the geometry constraints,
  so that we can prove or disprove properties of it with our algebraic methods efficiently. Especially,
  with Geometric Drawing, all nondegenerate conditions can be generated automatically.</p>
<p class="STYLE12">2. Use of Algebraic Equations</p>
<p>A geometrical constraint in the hypotheses can be represent as one or two polynomial equalities on
  the coordinates of points. For example, for predicate that A, B, C are collinear, the corresponding
  polynomial equation is: <img src="effects/e1.gif" width="325" height="23" />. In this way, the hypotheses can
  be expressed as a set of polynomial equations: </p>
<p><img src="effects/equation1.gif" width="400" height="130" /><br />
  The next step is to triangulate 3 the polynomial set so that each polynomial introduces only one
  new (dependent) variable xi. Thus the polynomial set is transformed to triangular form: </p>
<p><img src="effects/equation2.gif" width="400" height="130" /><br />
  The variables <span class="STYLE3">u1, . . . , ud</span> can be arbitrarily chosen and once they are fixed, the variables <span class="STYLE3">x1, . . . , xr</span> can be successively solved. When one or two of variables <span class="STYLE3">u1, . . . , ud</span> are changed with the mouse,
  then the variables of <span class="STYLE3">x1, . . . , xr</span> are updated to achieve the dynamic geometry effects. </p>
<p><br />
  One of advantages of this approach to drawing is that the reasoning with algebraic methods can
  be immediately applied to the diagram. Currently, we have implemented Wu’s method in JGEX
  and the Gr¨obner basis methods for various formulations (see [4]) are under implementing. Many<br />
  important and subtle geometry issues are closed related to Wu’s method which are impossible to
  discuss without the underlying theory of Wu’s method.
  Another important advantage of use of polynomials is that we can construct all diagrams or cases
  with the leading degree in <span class="style2">x</span><span class="STYLE10">j </span>≤ 4, since JGEX implements the formulas for quadratic, cubic, and
  quartic equations. </p>
<p align="left"><span class="STYLE12">3. Elimination of Duplicated Points </span><br />
  As a direct application of the JGEX algebraic proof engine, we can eliminate a newly constructed
  point if it is identical to one of the previously constructed points. The three commercial systems
  can only eliminate this point numerically. Since drawing a geometry diagram is so easy with a few
  mouse clicks, we repeatedly observed this phenomenon at the early stage of developing JGEX. </p>
<p align="left">Example. Let ABC be an isosceles triangle with AB = AC.
  Reflecting AB with respect to (wrpt) BC, we get segment BA';
  then reflecting AC wrpt BC, we get segment CA''. Points A'
  and A'' are actually identical. </p>
<p align="left"><br />
  This is a simple example, but we have also encountered cases in
  which the identity itself is a relatively deep theorem. Here is our
  approach. Whenever a new point is constructed, we first check
  whether this point is identical to a previous one numerically. If
  so, we use Wu’s method to check the identity. If the identity is
  valid, we eliminate this point. Without the powerful algebraic
  
  proof engine, it could eliminate the redundant points with only approximate
  numerical computations. But approximate
  numerical computations does not prove points A and
  X to be identical. </p>
<h5 align="left" class="STYLE12"><br />
  4. Automated Generation of Nondegenerate conditions </h5>
<p align="left"><br />
  A geometry theorem is true generally under some additional conditions called nondegenerate
  conditions. The identification of nondegenerate conditions is subtle.<br />
                  <br />
                  <strong>Figure 2: One Form of the Nine-Point Circle Theorem</strong><br />
                  <span class="STYLE3">Example 1. (One form of the nine-point circle theorem) Let points D, E and F be the three feet
                    of the altitudes of triangle ABC. Let N be such that NF = NE and NF = ND, and M be the
                    midpoint of AB. Then NM = NF. </span> </p>
<p align="center"><img src="effects/9pt.gif" width="468" height="225" border="1" /><br />
  For this example, beside the condition that A, B and C are not collinear, we need at least the
  nondegenerate condition that triangle ABC is not a right triangle, a subtle condition which is
  not easy to detect. However, with geometric drawing and the reasoning ability of JGEX, we can
  generate the nondegenerate conditions for a class of geometry statements of the constructive type. </p>
<p align="left"><br />
  The existence of point N implies the nondegenerate condition that points D, E, F are not collinear.
  Since points D, E, F are fixed points, we need to generate nondegenerate conditions that only
  contains free points. This is not an easy work, however, we can generate the polynomial equations<br />
  for this nondegenerate condition and check if the hypotheses are consistent or not with Wu’s method.
  This is very useful for a theorem to be complete. For most of the theorems we encountered, the
  nondegenerate conditions with geometric meanings can be generated automatically and thus we
  can give a complete description of the geometry statements. </p>

  The Six Different Methods </h4>
<p class="wikitext">Java Geometry Expert (<strong>JGEX</strong>)  is a powerful computer program for geometric reasoning. Within its domain, it  invites comparison with the best of human geometry provers. It implements most  of the effective methods for geometric reasoning introduced in the past twenty  years.  JGEX also implements the the  following methods. ( <strong>Note</strong>: in this beta version, the area method and vector method is under developing). </p>
<p class="wikitext"><br />
    <strong>1. <a href="wu.html">Wu's method</a></strong> is the most powerful method in terms of proving difficult geometry  theorems. Wu's method is a coordinate-based method. It first  transfers geometry conditions into poiynomial equations in the coordinates of  the points involved, then deals with the polynomial equations with the  characteristic set method. </p>
<p class="wikitext"><strong>2. <a href="groebner.html">The Groebner basis method</a></strong> is also a coordinate-based method.  Instead of using the characteristic set method, it uses the Grobner basis  method to deal with the polynomial equations.</p>
<p class="wikitext"><br />
  <strong>3. <a href="area.html">The area method</a></strong> uses high-level geometric lemmas about geometry invariants such  as the area and the Pythagorean difference as the basic tool of proving  geometry theorems. The method has been used to produce short, elegant, and  human- readable proofs for more than 500 geometry theorems. </p>
<p class="wikitext"><strong>4. <a href="full_angle_method.html">The full-angle method</a></strong> is based on the calculation of full-angles. Full-angle  method is not a decision procedure. But this method also has its  advantages: all the proofs produced by the method are very short, and it has  been used to prove several theorems that all the other methods fail to prove  because of very large polynomials occurring in the proving process. </p>
<p class="wikitext">5. <a href="deductive_database.html"><strong>The Deductive Database Method</strong></a> based on Full-Angle. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>6. Vector method</strong> This method is a variant of the area method and is based on the  calculation of vectors and complex numbers.</p>
<p class="wikitext"><br />
  <br />
  To use more than one method in the prover, we can produce a variety of proofs  with different styles. This might be important in using JGEX to geometry  education, since different methods allow students to explore different and  better proofs. </p>
