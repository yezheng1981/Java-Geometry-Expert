<h2>Preface to JGEX </h2>
<p>JGEX is a system which combines dynamic geometry software (<strong class="wiki">DGS</strong>), automated
              geometry theorem prover (<span class="wiki"><strong>GTP</strong></span>) and our approach for  visually dynamic
              presentation of proofs (<span class="wiki"><strong>VDDP</strong></span>). As a dynamic  geometry software, JGEX can be used to build dynamic visual  models to assist teaching and learning of various mathematical  concepts.  As an automated reasoning software, we can build  dynamic logic models which can do reasoning themselves. As a tool for  dynamic
              presentation of proofs, JGEX is a valuable
              for teachers and students to write and present proofs of geometry
      theorems with various dynamic visual effects.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.mmrc.iss.ac.cn/gex/">Geometry Expert</a></strong> was originally developed in 1994-1995 at WSU by  S. C. Chou, X.  S. Gao, and J. Z. Zhang. The Java version of GEX (<strong>JGEX</strong>) initially began in early 2004. However, the intensive work has been  done since Zheng Ye at Zhejiang University, came to Wichita State University in November  2004.     </p>
<p>The Wichita State University Geometry Theorem Proving Group  is a direct descendent of <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/atp/">The UT Automatic  Theorem Proving Group</a> The leader of this group, S. C. Chou, was a 1985 Ph.D. student  of R. S.  Boyer and J S. Moore. Professor Boyer was a 1971  Ph.D. student of Woody Bledsoe.</p>
<p>The current version of JGEX is <strong>0.80 Beta</strong>. It's a beta version because we believe that there are still some bugs need to be fixed. However, we want to deliver this version to the users who are interested in JGEX so that they can help us to improve JGEX. </p>
<p>In order  to run JGEX, the user needs to  download the <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp"> Java Runtime Environment</a>    by going to Sun's download page</p>
