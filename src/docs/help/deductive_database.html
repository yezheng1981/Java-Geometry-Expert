<h2>Deductive Database Method based on Full-Angle </h2>
<p>  Given a geometry statement of the equality type, each hypothesis is considered as a fact (a property).
  All hypotheses of the statement form the initial database <strong>D0</strong> of facts. Then we apply the rule
  set R to D0 to get new facts. We expand the database D0 by adding the new facts to D0 to have
  the enlarged database <strong>D1</strong>. We repeat the process for D1 to have an enlarged database <strong>D2</strong>. Since
  the number of points is finite, the numbers of segments, of angles, of triangles, and of circles are
  also finite. This process will finally terminate, i.e., there is k â‰¥ 0 such that <strong>Dk</strong> = <strong>Dk</strong>+1. Then
  we call Dk the fixpoint of the given geometric configuration. This process can be expressed by the
  following diagram:<br />

<p>JGEX uses <span class="wiki">breadth first forward chaining method</span> to find new properties of this diagram. The naive form of breadth-rst forward chaining is notorious for its inefficiency. But, in the case of geometry, by using techniques from the theory of
  deductive database [6] and by introducing new search techniques, we manage
  to build a very effective prover based on this simple idea</p>
<p>  Since the rule set R and the structured database are built into the source code, the prover is very
  efficient and the fixpoint can be generally reached within a fraction of a second even for an antique
  Pentium machine. If the conclusion (a fact also) is in the fixpoint, then we prove the statement to
  be true and the proof can be generated.</p>
<p><br />
  In JGEX, there are only 43 rules instead of 75 rules in [5], because some rules have been built
  into the structure of the deductive database. Please see <a href="lemmas.html">Rules for Deductive Database Method</a>. <a href="pdf/Automated Generation of Readable Proofs with2.pdf"><br>
  </a></p>
<p>For detail of this method please<a href="pdf/jar-gdbase.pdf"> read our paper &gt;&gt; </a></p>

<h3>Showing the Fixpoint. <a name="fixpoint" id="fixpoint"></a></h3>
<p>Generally, the fixpoint has surprisingly rich amounts of information even for a very simple configuration.
  We can classify the facts in the fixpoint into several classes according to the geometric
  predicates: collinear, parallel, perpendicular, segment equal, cyclic, (full) angle equal, triangle<br />
  congruence, etc.</p>
<p><br />
  After the fixpoint is reached, we organize the database as an two-level tree. In this way, the user
  can explore the database to find some interesting facts.</p>
<p>For a theorem, please use the <strong>tabbed pane with &quot;Fix&quot; highlighted</strong> to see the fixpoint of the theorem. </p>
