  <h3>Rulers for Full Angle Method <a name="full" id="full"></a></h3>
  <p>  1.
If AB ∥ BC, then Collinear(A,B,C).</p>
  <p> 2.
  For two angle ∠[l1,l2], ∠[l3,l4]. If l1 = l3 and l2 ∥ l4, then ∠[l1,l2] = ∠[l3,l4].<br />
  For example, in parallelogram ABCD, AD ∥ BC and AC = CA, hence ∠[CAD] = ∠[ACB].</p>
  <p> 3.
  if AB ∥ CD and E is the intersection of AC and BD, then EA / EC = EB / ED.</p>
  <p> 4.
  If AB ∥ CD and CD ⊥ EF, then AB ⊥ EF.</p>
  <p> 5.
  If AB ⊥ CD, then ∠[AB,CD] = [1] ( or 90 degrees).</p>
  <p> 6.
  In right riangle ACB, ∠C = [1], if  midpoint(E, A B), then Circumcenter (E,A B C) and EA = EB = EC.</p>
  <p> 7.
  If AB ⊥ CD and CD ⊥ EF, then AB ∥ EF.</p>
  <p> 8.
  For four points A,B,C,D, if AC ⊥ BC and AD ⊥ BD, then Cyclic(A,B,C,D).</p>
  <p> 9.
  For a circle c(O,AB) and a point C on Circle c, if Collinear(A,B,O), then AC ⊥ BC and ∠ACB = [1].</p>
  <p> 10.
  If AB is the Diameter of a circle and point C is on the circle, then AC ⊥ BC,</p>
  <p> 11. 
  Angle of circumference equals to half of angle of center,</p>
  <p>  12.
  If AB ∥ CD and Cyclic(A,B,C,D), then ∠ABC = ∠DAB.</p>
  <p>  13.
  If Cyclic(A,B,C,D), then ∠ADB = ∠ACB and vice verse.</p>
  <p>  14.
  Chord tangent angle  ,</p>
  <p>  15.
  Line passing the centers of two circles is perpendicular to the common chord of two circles.  ,<br />
  For example, two circles C1(O,AB) and C2(O1,AB), AB are two common points, then OO1 ⊥ AB.</p>
  <p>  16.
  The Addition for Full Angle.<br />
  If ∠[l1,l2] = ∠[l3,l4] and ∠[l5,l6] = ∠[l7,l8], and l2 = l6 and l4 = l7, then ∠[l1,l4] = ∠[l5,l8] ,</p>
  <p>  17.
  ASPP12.<br />
  If ∠[l1,l2] = ∠[l3,l4] and l1 ∥ l2, then l3 ∥ l4.<br />
  Because if l1 ∥ l2, ∠[l1,l2] = [0]. Hence ∠[l3,l4] = [0].</p>
  <p>  18.
  ASPP13,<br />
  If ∠[l1,l2] = ∠[l3,l4] and l1 ∥ l3, then l2 ∥ l4.  </p>
  <p>  19.
  ASTT12,<br />
  If ∠[l1,l2] = ∠[l3,l4] and l1 ⊥  l2, then l3 ⊥  l4.</p>
  <p>  20.
  ASTT13,<br />
  If ∠[l1,l2] = ∠[l3,l4] and l1 ⊥  l3, then l2 ⊥  l4.</p>
  <p>  21.
  Special Angles,</p>
  <p>  22.
  Supplementary Angle,</p>
  <p>  23.
  Isoceless Triangle.</p>
  <p>  24 Isoceless Triangle Theorem.<br />
  For a isoceless triangle ABC and a point D on line BC, if any one of following statement is true, the other two are also true .<br />
  <strong>1.</strong> AD ⊥ BC,     <strong>2.</strong> D is the midpoint of BC,   <strong>3.</strong> ∠BAD = ∠DAC,</p>
  <p>  25.
  Congruent Triangle. ,<br />
  Triangles are called congruent if they have the same size and shape. That is, corresponding angles have the same measure, and corresponding sides have the same length.</p>
  <p>  26  #ASA,<br />
  ASA (angle-side-angle) congruence: ,<br />
  Two triangles are congruent if a pair of corresponding angles and the included side are equal. ,</p>
  <p>  27 #SAS,<br />
  SAS(side-angle-side) congruence,<br />
  Two triangles are congruent if a pair of corresponding sides and the included angle are equal.</p>
  <p>  28 #SSS,<br />
  SSS (side-side-side) congruence,<br />
  Two triangles are congruent if their corresponding sides are equal.</p>
  <p>  29 #SAS,<br />
  SAS (side-angle-side) congruence for right triangles.<br />
  Two right triangle are congruent if their two corresponding cartesian edges are equal. ,</p>
  <p>  30.
  Similar triangles,<br />
  Similar triangles are triangles that have the same shape but possibly different size. In particular, corresponding angles are congruent, and corresponding sides are in proportion.</p>
  <p>  31 #AAA,<br />
  AAA (angle-angle-angle) similarity,<br />
  If two triangles have two corresponding angles that are congruent, then the triangles are similar. Because the sum of the angles in a triangle must be PI, we really only need to know that two pairs of corresponding angles are congruent to know the triangles are similar.</p>
  <p>  32 #SAS,<br />
  SAS (side-angle-side) similarity,<br />
  The side-angle-side (SAS) similarity test says that if two triangles have two pairs of sides that are proportional and the included angles are congruent, then the triangles are similar. ,</p>
  <p>  33 #SSS,<br />
  SSS (side-side-side) similarity,<br />
  If two triangles have all three pairs of sides in proportion, the triangles are similar.</p>
  <p>  34.
  Ratio by similarity,</p>
  <p>  35.
  Middle Connection Theorem for Triangles,<br />
  The line connect the midpoints of two sides of triangle is parallel to the third side of the triangle.</p>
  <p>  36.
  The hypotenuse of a right triangle is the diameter of the circumscribed circle of the triangle, and the midpoint of the hypotenuse is the center of the circle.<br />
  For a right triangle ACB, if AC ⊥ BC and D is the midpoint of AB,  then DC = DA = DB, D is the center of circle ABC.</p>
  <p>  37.
  Equalateral Triangles,<br />
  An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides have equal lengths.</p>
  <p>  38.
  Pythagorean Theorem,<br />
  In any right triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse (the side of a right triangle opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs (i.e. the two sides other than the hypotenuse). ,</p>
  <p>  39.
  The sum of three interior angles of a triangle is [0]. (or 180 degree for traditional angle).</p>
  <p>  40.
  Parallelogram ,<br />
  A parallelogram is a quadrilateral with two sets of opposite parallel sides.</p>
  <p>  41.
  Middle Connection Theorem for Trapzoid.</p>
  <p>   42.
  Ratio ,<br />
  Use Ratio in Deductive Database Method. </p>
  <p>  43.
  Ratio by angle bisector,<br />
  In triangle ABC, if AD is the bisector of angle A, and D is on line BC, then AB/BD = AC/DC.  </p>

  <h3>Rulers for GDD method <a name="gdd" id="gdd"></a></h3>
  <p>  1. The Definition of Full Angle.<br />
A full angle is defined as an ordered pair of two lines u and v denoted by ∠[u,v].</p>
  <p>  2.
  ∠[u,v] =  - ∠[v,u].</p>
  <p>  3.
  ∠[u,v] = ∠[0] if and only if u ∥ v  (including u = v).</p>
  <p>  4.
  ∠[u,v] = ∠[1] if and only if u ⊥ v.</p>
  <p>  5 # Addition of Full Angle.<br />
  ∠[u,s] + ∠[s,v] = ∠[u,v].  This rule to split an angle into two or more angles.<br />
  For example, for any line m, we have  ∠[u,v] =  ∠[u,m] +  ∠[m,v],</p>
  <p>  6.
  If l ⊥ v or ∠[l,v] = ∠[1],  then ∠[u,v] = ∠[u,l] + ∠[l,v] = ∠[u,l] + ∠[1].<br />
  For example, if we have AC ⊥ BC, then  ∠[CBA] = ∠[BAC] + ∠[1].</p>
  <p>  7.
   The Isoceless Triangle Theorem for Full Angle.<br />
   If AC = BC, we have ∠[ABC] = ∠[CAB]. Conversely, if ∠[ABC] = ∠[CAB], then AB = AC or A, B and C are collinear.</p>
  <p>  8.
   The Inscribed Angle Theorem.<br />
   Points A,B,C and D are cylic iff ∠[ABC] = ∠[ADC].</p>
  <p>  9.
   If Cyclic( A,B,M,N),  then ∠[AB, AM] = ∠[BN,NM].  Hence we have  ∠[AB, CD] = ∠[AB, AM] + ∠[AM, CD] = ∠[BN,NM]] + ∠[AM, CD].</p>
  <p>  10.
   Rule 10.</p>
  <p>  11.
   If AB is the diameter of the circumcircle of triangle ABC and D is on the circumcircle, then for any line FG, we have ∠[CD,FG] = ∠[DBA] + ∠[ACB] + ∠[BC, FG]].</p>
  <p>  12. If O is the intersection of Circle(O1, O P1 P3 I ) and Circle(O2, O P2 P4 J ) and Collinear(O, I, J), then ∠[P1O, OP2] = ∠[P1P2, IP3] + ∠[JP4, P2P4].</p>
  <p>  13.
   If O is the circumcenter of triangle ABC, then ∠[BOC] = 2  ∠[BAC].</p>
  <p>  14.
   For a circle(O, A B C D), if O is the intersection of AD and BC, then ∠[AOB] = 2  ∠[CDA].</p>
  <p>  15.
   For a circle(O, A B), O is the center of circle, we have ∠[OAB] = ∠[ABO]. ,</p>
  <p>  16.
   If triangle ABE is a right triangle and O is the midpoint of the hypotenuse(i.e. AB), then for any line CD, we have,<br />
   ∠[AB, CD] =  ∠[BAE] + ∠[1] + ∠[BE, CD]  ,</p>
  <p>  17.
   For a circle(O, ABC) and D is midpoint of BC, we have ∠[AB, EF] = ∠[BOD] + ∠[AC,EF]. ,</p>
  <p>  18.
   For a circle(O,ABF) and E is the midpoint of AF, we have ∠[AB, CD] = ∠[EOA] + ∠[BF, CD].</p>
  <p>  19.
   If G is the orthocenter of A, B, C, ∠[AE, HI] = ∠[AE, BE] + ∠[BE, HI] = ∠[1] + ∠[BE, HI],</p>
  <p>  20.
  If A is the incenter of P2, K, I,  ∠[AB, CD] = ∠[AB, BK] + ∠[BK, CD] = ∠[1] + ∠[KI, KA] + ∠[IA, IK] + ∠[BK, CD].</p>
  <p>  21.
   Equal Angle found in Geometry Deductive Database.</p>
  <p>   22.
   If AB ⊥ AC and AB = AC, then ∠[AB,AC] = 2  ∠[AB,BC].</p>
  <p>   23.
   If AB ⊥ AC and AB = AC, then 2  ∠[AB,DE] = 2  ∠[AB,BC] + 2  ∠[BC,DE] = ∠[1] +2  ∠[BC,DE].</p>
  <p>   24.
   If OB // DE and A is on Circle(O,B), then 2  ∠[AB, DE] = ∠[OA,OB],</p>
  <p>   25.
   A is on Circle(O,B), then 2  ∠[AB, DE] = ∠[OA,OB] + 2  ∠[OA,DE],</p>
  <p>   26.
   CD is the diameter of Circle(A, BCD), AB ⊥ CD, then  2  ∠[DB,BA]  = ∠[0].</p>
  <p>   27.
   A, B, C, D, E are cyclic and AC = AB, then 2∠[AB, BC] =  ∠[CE, ED].</p>
  <p>   28.
   If A, B, E, F, G are cyclic and AE = AF, then 2  ∠[AB, CD] =  2  ∠[BE, CD] +  ∠[EG, GF].</p>
  <p>   29.
   If AB = AC = BC, i.e. triangle ABC is an equilateral triangle, then 3  ∠[AB, BC] = ∠[0].  ,</p>
